# Reconocimiento_Facial_usando_PCA_y_LDA
In this notebook we explore the face recognition problem using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, available in sklearn via the fetch_lfw_people function. This dataset contains images of faces of public figures, mainly captured in informal contexts, making it an interesting challenge for classification and recognition tasks.
